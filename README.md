# Little Red Car Game

## Running Instructions

### Important:
If you directly download and run this project, you might find that the screen displays nothing. This is likely because the **working directory** is not set correctly.

### Solution:

Make sure you are running the project from the correct working directory, which should point to the root directory of the project.


### Steps to Configure:
1. **Open IntelliJ IDEA**, and go to **Run** -> **Edit Configurations...**
2. In the left panel, select your run configuration (typically of type `Application`).
3. On the right panel, ensure that the **Working directory** field is set to the root directory of the project:
4. Make sure the **Use classpath of module** option is set to the correct module, usually `Little-Red-Car-Game-master` or a similar name. Many users often miss a layer of the path (the 'Little-Red-Car-Game-master' folder) when they directly decompress the project to their computer. In this case, simply adding this layer of the path will fix the issue.
5. Save the configuration by clicking **Apply** or **OK**.
